# Project 4
### By: Angela Chih

For project 4 I chose **Option 2: Single-Mode Base Pong**

Make sure you install *pyglet* in your terminal `$ pip install pyglet` or you may refer to **requirements.txt**

To view instructions on pyglet installation: https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/pyglet-1.3-maintenance/programming_guide/installation.html

I forked the sample provided by the professor "https://github.com/si507-w19/Sample-Pyglet-Code"

**I then followed the instructions on the `Project4_tasks.md`**
- Removed the 2nd player paddle
- Creating 6-deep floor to ceiling wall
- Making the bricks disappear when the ball hits one of them
- Keeping track of how many balls are being hit and speeding it up after 10 bricks are successfully broken

**The features I have added to the game are...** 
- Redesigning the assets for the game to make it visually appealing
	- The Paddle Board
	- The Borders 
	- The Ball
- The Blocks
	- I changed the arrows to the *up* and *down* keys
	- Removed the Score Text on the game screen
